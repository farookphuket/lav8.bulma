    Were it not for the challenges of the 2020 pandemic, there׳s a very good chance the return of the Chevrolet Trailblazer nameplate would have been a much bigger deal. Instead, we had to wait a year to finally test and evaluate it. Slotting in between the tiny Chevy Trax and the larger Equinox, the 2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer is one of the latest entrants in the burgeoning subcompact crossover SUV class. We׳re pleasantly surprised with how it turned out, too.
</p>
<p>
    Among its assets is an optional 1.3-liter engine that gets the Trailblazer up to speed with relative ease while the suspension delivers both a comfortable ride and confident cornering. To add to the appeal, the interior is attractively styled and comes well stocked with technology features. There׳s also a decent amount of backseat and cargo space. The Trailblazer manages to stand out from the crowd, too, with aggressive Camaro-like styling.
